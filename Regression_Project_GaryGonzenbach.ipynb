    "(see background)...your customer is the zillow data science team.  state your goals as if you were delivering this to zillow.  They have asked for something from you (see 'background') and you are basically communicating in a more concise way, and very clearly, the goals as you understand them and as you have taken and acted upon through your research. \n",

    "*Project Overview\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "Zillow wants to improve their Zestimate. The zestimate is estimated value of a home. Zillow theorizes that there is more information to be gained to improve its existing model. Because of that, Zillow wants you to develop a model to predict the error between the Zestimate and the sales price of a home. In predicting the error, you will discover features that will help them improve the Zestimate estimate itself. Your goal of this project is to develop a linear regression model that will best predict the log error of the Zestimate. The error is the difference of the sales price and the Zestimate. The log error is computed by taking the log function of that error. You don't need to worry about the fact that the error is of a logarithmic function. It is a continuous number that represents an error rate.*\n",

    "What should the zillow team expect to receive from you?  Again, as you were communicating to them, not to your instructors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*your deliverables:*\n",
    "1. *A report (in the form of a presentation, both verbal and through a slides) that summarizes your findings about the drivers of the Zestimate error. This will come from the analysis you do during the exploration phase of the pipeline. In the report, you will have charts that visually tell the story of what is driving the errors.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *A Jupyter notebook, titled 'Regression_Proj_YourName', that contains a clearly labeled section and code clearly documented for each the stages below (project planning, data acquisition, data prep, exploration, and modeling). All of the work will take place in your jupyter notebook.*"
